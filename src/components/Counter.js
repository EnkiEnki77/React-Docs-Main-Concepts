    // Your event handlers should be a method on the class, class methods are not bound to the this of the class by default though.
    // You should bind them manually in the constructor. Otherwise this will be undefined when you go to pass them to an event listener. 
    // There are two ways to get around binding, wrap the event handler instance in a callback AF that invokes it, or make the event 
    // handler an arrow function, arrow functions have a lexical this, meaning they take on the this of the top level of the class. 
    // Using arrow functions for methods is also known as public class fields syntax. Dont use the second way if passing to a child
    // through props, it may cause a second rerender. 
    // Its common in instances such as a loop to want to pass additional arguments to an event handler, this is one instance where
    // using the second way is needed ex: onClick((e) => this.increment(id, e)), if doing this in a class you can also just bind 
    // this and the argument to the handler tho. onClick(this.increment.bind(this, id)), in both instances e is the second argument. 
    // in the arrow function example you must explicitly define e. 
    increment = () => {
        // Multiple setState calls would generally each trigger a rerender from React, but if youre making multiple seState calls in one
        // component at once this can be very ineffecient and cause a component and its children to rerender more than needed. So now
        // all set state calls in a component are batched into one update in order to prevent unnecessary rerenders. This makes setState
        // asynchronous, because of this you cannot rely on current state to calculate next state, such as in a counter. THis is because
        // when setState is added to the callback queue it is passed the current state at the time of it being invoked. So even if you 
        // made 100 calls to increment a count state none of them have actually changed the state by the time the last one is invoked, 
        // so the count will still only ever increment by 1
        // both calls rely on current state at time of the call for incrementing, because setState is async you can make this call
        // infinite times, but none of the calls will know about the incrementation done by any of the others, so the state will only 
        // increment once per event
        this.setState({count: this.state.count + this.props.increment})
        this.setState({count: this.state.count + this.props.increment})
        console.log(this.state.count)

        // There is a callback you can pass to setState, it takes in the previous state from the output of last setState call, and the 
        // current props at time of update as inputs. It always operates based off the output of the last setState call, so if you 
        // had 4 other setState calls before it that were also utilizing the call back it would increment by 5, but putting just
        // one call that doesnt utilize the callback between them would make it increment only by 2, this is because without the callback 
        // the setState call wouldnt know about the state outputted by the 4 calls before it, and would operate off the current state 
        // of 0. Meaning the last setState call which utilizes the callback would be working with a prevState of 1. 
        // this.setState((prev, props) => ({count: prev.count + props.increment}))
        // this.setState((prev, props) => ({count: prev.count + props.increment}))
        // this.setState((prev, props) => ({count: prev.count + props.increment}))
        // this.setState((prev, props) => ({count: prev.count + props.increment}))
        // this.setState({count: this.state.count + this.props.increment})
        // this.setState((prev, props) => ({count: prev.count + props.increment}))

        // when you call setState React merges the object you provide with the current state. So if you have multiple states defined.
        // in this.state you can make individual setState calls to change those states and only the states referenced in those calls 
        // will be changed. 
        // if your state is this.state = {count: 0, favorite: true} like in this componnet for example. You could make this setState call
        this.setState({favorite: false})
        // This is what it would actually be converted to under the hood before setting the state. A shallow merge
        this.setState(prevState => ({...prevState, favorite: false}))
        // And the state would then be this this.state = {count: 0, favorite: false}
    }

    // Neither child nor parent should need to know whether a component is stateful or not, state is encapsulated entirely within 
    // the component it is defined, and can only be changed from that component. State data may be passed to children as props. 
    // This does not give the child any indication that its props are state or where they came from though. 
    // React has a unidirectional data flow, meaning that state is always owned by the component it is defined, and any data derived
    // from state can only be passed downwards through props. 
    render() {

        the components lifecycle methods from running though*/

                prevent default behaviour. You have to call the event.preventDefault method explicitly. The event object is a synthetic
